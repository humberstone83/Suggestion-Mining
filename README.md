# Suggestion-Mining

Suggestion Mining: Expanding the use of Long-Short Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks
By Jack Humberstone

This folder contains 4 ipython notebooks, opening these notebooks using juptyr notebook will allow for the full running of the presented code.

These notebooks are:
1. Preprocessing
2. Data Augmentation
3. Suggestion Classification
4. Results

A number of pickle files are also included containing various information that can be transferred across the notebooks meaning they can be run in any order. Running the notebooks in order will also create the required pickle files should they be missing. 

The glove word embeddings files are also included along with the datasets from the 2019 semeval competition into suggestion mining. 

Several python libraries will need to be installed prior to the running of any of the python notebooks, these are:
